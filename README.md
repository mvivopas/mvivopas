### Hi there 👋

This is the space I use to work on open projects when I find some spare time (not as frequently as I would like). 
Thus, here you'll find some of my side projects. I'm very passionate about informatics in general and data science
in particular. The field I'm currently most immersed in is NLP, of course, as my job in IOMED involves NLP engineering, and honestly, because it is such an insightful, undiscovered domain.

Other things that may interest you to know about me are:

- 🔡 I'm currently working on NLP
- 🏄🏽‍♀️🗿 I'm currently learning how to surf and boulder
- 👥 I'm looking to collaborate on appealing ideas
