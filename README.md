### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my dedicated corner for nurturing open projects during those rare moments of free time (which I wish were more frequent). 
Here, you'll discover a collection of my personal endeavors. I enjoy collaborating on projects, no matter the subject, if interested,
do not hesitate to reach me ([Linkedin], [Email]).

If you're curious to learn more about me and delve deeper into my projects, feel free to visit my [website]. There, I provide a more 
extensive introduction to myself, along with insights into my educational and professional journey. Additionally, you'll find detailed 
posts where I delve into the inner workings and logic behind some of my favorite projects.
