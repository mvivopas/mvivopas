### Hi there 👋

This is the space I use to work on open projects when I find some spare time (not as frequently as I would like). 
Thus, here you'll find some of my side projects. I'm very passionate about informatics in general and data science
in particular. The field I'm currently most immersed in is NLP, of course, as my job in IOMED involves NLP engineering, and honestly, because it is such an insightful, undiscovered domain.

Other things that may interest you to know about me are:

- 🔡 I'm currently working on NLP
- 🏄🏽‍♀️ I'm currently learning how to surf
- 👥 I'm looking to collaborate on appealing ideas
- 📫 How to reach me: [Linkedin], [Email]
- ⚡ Fun fact: i love _animals_ 🦥 and i love _travelling_ ✈️ and i mean it. I grew up in Menorca's countryside, surrounded by farm animals (actually, they were my neighbors', but anyway) and domestic animals (though my cats/dogs/chickens are way wilder than the average). For the traveling part, I have been living for almost two months in South Africa 🌍 working remotely 👩🏽‍💻, and the only thing I can think about is traveling and discovering.
